[[Animation]]
[[Blender to Unity]]

To import mixamo animation to blender first open the 3D model in blender (T-pose if possible because it is Mixamo default pose), then import the Mixamo animations (without skin), then in animation tab you can open  a dope sheet window and select action editor.

In action editor you can select and rename imported animation, once you're done you can delete all skeletons but the model one, the animation will stay.

Select the 3D model from the hierarchy, then in action editor you can play animations on your imported model
